Beta-3 of Vektor includes some internal changes, and improvements to how VK's HTTP mode is handled.

This release is a breaking change, `UseInsecureHTTP` has been changed to `UseHTTPPort` and the default HTTP port for LetsEncrypt challenges has been changed from 80 to 8080. The HTTP port option is now respected by the LetsEncrypt challenge server. VK will always default to TLS, and will only use HTTP mode if the DOMAIN option is not set AND the HTTP port option is explicitly set.
